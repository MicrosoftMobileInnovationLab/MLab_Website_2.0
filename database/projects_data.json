Say chef-A fashions a particularly scrumptious starter dish-X while being moderately skilled at making the main course\ndish-Y and sadly, makes a rather foul dessert dish-Z.

Now, if you wanted a 3-course meal, what are your chances of getting an optimal dish-A, dish-B and dish-C and in that particular order? Bleak indeed. This is pre-\ncisely the issue that Roadmap solves. Deconstructing the analogy, the chefs are websites and the dishes are resources. Akin to a meal, information must\nbe consumed in a particular order and from the right source(s). Roadmap identifies blocks of prerequisite information pertaining to the desired ob-\njective topic and presents a platter of ranked resources procured from apt sources. These tasks are accomplished by parsing through various resources\nand identifying parent-child relationships between entities by virtue of varied approaches such as semantic nets, N-space clustering, ANNs that analyse the\nstatistical occurrences of entities and even contextualised word embeddings.\n\nGoing back to the analogy one last time, Roadmap takes structured learning from \u201dtoo many chefs spoil the broth\u201d to \u201dthe more the merrier\u201d."}, "Timetable Generation": {"Name": "Timetable Generation", "interns": "Akash Hamirwasia, Rishit Chaudhary, Tanishq Vyas", "mentors": "Aishwarya Venkatesh, Ananya Ravikumar", "year": 2019, "imageURL": "", "PPT": "", "short summary": "Development of a web application to aid the process of Timetable Generation", "Project description": "Timetable scheduling can be designed as a constraint satisfaction problem and can be solved using various approaches.

Various approaches aimed at finding optimal solutions to such constraint satisfaction problems use constraint optimization, coupled with algorithms such as genetic, swarm particle optimization,\ntabu search etc. but these approaches are problem dependent and hence are infeasible in real-world situations.\nIn this project, a pure Linear Constrained Optimization approach consisting of integer programming using binary variables has been explored. The developed solver class was tested\nusing real-world data gathered from the various departments of a university. On further inspection, the constraints of every department were strikingly different from each other. The solver class to be successful must accommodate such diversities and still generate optimal results.
